# to-do's

 - [x] checkVictory() needs to not check for blank spaces in a row (read the lines into one string and only check for 'XXX' or 'OOO')
 - [x] checkVictory() needs to also handle games that end in draw. (if turns reach 9 and no victory, that means it's a draw)
 - [ ] sometimes a draw can occur when there's less than 9 moves (if it's 8 moves, and no victory can occur with either X or O in the last spot, you might as well declare a draw)
 - [ ] place play log on the right (with flex container?)
 - [ ] AI?
